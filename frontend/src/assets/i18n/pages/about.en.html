<h1>How does our simulation work?</h1>

<h2>The issues with modelling a pandemic</h2>

<p>
  As you may have noticed in the last year, predicting a pandemic is treacherous work. The public space
  was full of both overly optimistic and overly pessimistic forecasts. At this point, most of you
  probably
  think that it’s impossible to make a mathematical model for a pandemic, because there are too many unknown variables.
</p>

<p>
  That’s only partially true. What we really cannot predict is whether a big party will be visited by one
  infected person with no symptoms,
  causing a “cluster” (one of those words that has become much more commonplace in the last year).
  We also don’t know how the government will react (as a parent, I spent a lot of time wondering whether schools would close). And
  last but not least,
  we cannot say how other people will behave. But even in this uncertain situation, there are many things we do know. The
  success of the holiday we’re planning depends on the weather, our decisions and the decisions of the people around us. Nothing is
  completely certain, but it’s more probable the skiing will be good in February than in May.
</p>

<p>
  And “probability” is the key here. That’s a concept maths can encompass quite well. You never know
  whether a coin toss will end with heads or tails. And it’s even harder to guess the exact number of times you’ll get tails
  in a hundred tosses. What you can tell quite reliably, though, is that you will get tails “roughly” fifty times.
</p>

<p>
  Maths also cannot predict the movement of a human-controlled vehicle. I cannot calculate whether I’ll have an accident
  tomorrow. That mostly depends on my driving skills. I can, however, calculate my stopping distance
  at
  a certain speed. I can calculate what distance I’ll have left for stopping if fatigue slows down my reactions by a
  “blink of an eye”.
</p>


<h2>An epidemic as a computer game</h2>

<p>
  Due to the above-mentioned reasons, an epidemic cannot be predicted precisely. There’s both the human factor and coincidence to take into account.
  Professional epidemiologists have to use the language of probability, statistics, uncertainty, and possible
  scenarios. If you’re not proficient in this language, professional predictions may sound incomprehensible,
  inaccurate, and evasive. That is, however, quite far from the truth.
</p>

<p>
  Even though the language of formal mathematics is complex, we can all work with uncertainty and the “human factor”. It comes
  to us naturally in normal life. Did you know that the math problem for stopping a car is expressed by a second-order differential
  equation? Would you be able to solve that? Maybe not. But despite that, every driver can reliably stop their car.
  The differential equation does not determine where you go. Instead, it tells you how many meters it will take
  before you stop after hitting the brakes, in the cold, precise language of maths.
</p>

<p>
  We want to illustrate how an epidemic model works, the same way a driving simulator shows you
  how to drive. You’ll have to deal with the element of chance and the consequences of your own decisions. Just like
  in reality. The computer will do the work with complex equations. Maybe, in the end, you’ll find you understand them
  intuitively, without knowing advanced maths.
</p>

<p>
  Maybe you’d argue that the simulation is not real. You’d be right. For example, we have no exact data about how quickly the virus spreads
  in winter compared to the summer. We’re only using estimates. A real car’s brakes will also be different than the simulation.
   Real cars also differ from one another, but if you learn how to drive one of them, it’s not that hard to
  get used to another.
</p>


<h2>Epidemic model</h2>

<p>
  To model epidemics, we often use the
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4086157/">structured
    epidemic model</a>. Another popular one is the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model">SIR
    model</a>. SIR stands for <i>susceptible</i>, <i>infectious</i> and
  <i>resistant</i>.
</p>

<p>
  This model divides the population into three
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology">compartments</a>. Every
  <i>infectious</i> individual
  infects several others in turn (that's the well-known <i>R</i> number). All the <i>susceptible</i> individuals
  who have been infected transition to the <i>infectious</i> compartment. <i>Infectious</i> and <i>resistant</i> individuals cannot
  be reinfected. In time, <i>infectious</i> individuals recover and become <i>resistant</i>. We won’t get into the details of equations;
  for more information on the maths look
  <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/loci/joma/the-sir-model-for-spread-of-disease-the-differential-equation-model">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  In our case, we decided to use a more complex model. Specifically, we’re counting recovered individuals as only temporarily resistant,
  in a way similar to
  <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ddns/2015/720682/">the SIRS
  model</a>. The S at the end means that <i>resistant</i> individuals (R) become <i>susceptible</i> (S) again,
  as shown in the following diagram:
</p>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="assets/i18n/images/SIR.en.svg" class="model-img" alt="SIR model">
</div>

<p>
  We also took into account that after exposure, the infected individual goes through an incubation period
  and they’re not infectious during this time. We named this compartment <i>exposed</i> (E), based on the standard
  <a href="https://docs.idmod.org/projects/emod-hiv/en/latest/model-seir.html">SEIR
  model</a>. The <i>exposed</i> compartment gives the model more “momentum”. Even if you manage to slow
  down the spread of the disease to a significant degree, you will still have past infection cases. The diagram will then look like this:
</p>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="assets/i18n/images/SEIR.en.svg" class="model-img" alt="SEIR model">
</div>

<p>
  Following standard terminology, our model is based on the SEIRS model. However, the game has to work
  with a number of other figures, such as the number of active cases, hospitalization, and the sad number of
  deaths. The full diagram for our model would then look like this:
</p>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="assets/i18n/images/model.en.svg" class="model-img" alt="diagram modelu">
</div>


<h3>Diagnosed cases model</h3>

<p>
  Our model also takes into account the fact that not all infection cases get diagnosed and included in official statistics. This was quite a hot topic
  in the public debate. The estimated real incidence determines the estimated mortality of
  Covid-19. Official statistics in Czechia report 909,131 cases of infection and 14,820 deaths before 19 January 2021.
  If we simply divide one number by the other, mortality equals 1.6%. This number does not include exposed individuals who will die
  in the future (if we count the delay of deaths to detected infections as 14 days, mortality rises to
  1.9%). In fact, there could be up to
  <a href="https://www.mpg.de/14909105/0605-defo-137749-how-many-people-actually-have-covid-19">four times
  as many </a> Covid cases than the official numbers show. The real mortality would therefore be much lower.
   In our model, the mortality rate is 0.5% and the rate of diagnosed cases is 25 %. That is the more
  conservative
  <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/estimating-mortality-from-covid-19">estimate
  by the World Health Organisation</a>.
</p>


<h3>SEIRS model implementation</h3>

<p>
  When estimating the parameters of the disease, we decided to use the more optimistic estimates. We don’t want to be accused of
  “fearmongering” and the game is still quite difficult.
</p>

<p>
  The mathematical expressions of epidemic models tend to use systems of differential equations
  (such as the previously cited
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model">SIR
  model</a>). To simplify, we replaced differential equations with
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation">difference equations</a>, with each element
  of the sequence representing one day. This model is called
  <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/odin/vignettes/discrete.html">the discrete SIR
  model</a>.
</p>

<h3>Calculating new cases</h3>
<p>
  When calculating the number of new cases, we presume that every <i>infectious</i> (I) individual, within their infectious period
  (labelled <i>d<sub>I</sub></i>), infects R other individuals (we’ll mention how we calculate the <i>reproduction number</i> R later). In one day,
  every <i>infectious</i> individual transmits the disease to <i>R * I / d<sub>I</sub></i> other people. We have to consider,
  that out of the pool of exposed people, only <i>susceptible</i> (S) individuals will get infected. The rate of
  <i>susceptible</i> individuals
  in the population <i>P</i> is calculated as <i>S / P</i>. This gives us the formula for calculating the number of new infections<br>
  <i> E = R * I / d<sub>I</sub> * S / P + borders</i>,<br>
  with <i>borders</i> referring to the number of cross-border infections.
</p>

<p>
  This is the most complicated formula you’ll see in this text and the core of our model. The simulation
  also multiplies the number of new infections by a random number from the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution">log-normal
  distribution</a> to reflect the element of chance in the epidemic.
</p>

<p>
  The number of cross-border infections was calibrated using the
  <a href="https://kafkadesk.org/2020/09/27/central-europe-from-covid-success-story-to-symbol-of-crisis-mismanagement/">estimated
  extent of the first wave</a> (the first cases were cross-border infections) at 70 infections per day (roughly 20
  diagnosed cases per day). The Czech Republic cannot hermetically seal its borders; even with a full travel ban,
  our game will have about 10 new infections per day (2.5 diagnosed cases per day).
</p>

<h3>Duration of illness and the infectious period</h3>

<p>
  The time before an <i>exposed</i> individual (E) becomes <i>infectious</i> (I) was modelled using exponential
  distribution. The mean value was roughly 6 days and the median was 4 days. That is one day less than what
  <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/coronavirus-incubation-period">other sources</a> state. We presume
  that an exposed person can start spreading the virus before symptoms develop.
</p>

<p>
  We set the infectious period at four days. The maximum infectious period is longer, but most exposures occur
  shortly before and shortly after the symptoms develop. The time between exposure and registration in official statistics
  was set very optimistically at two days in our simulation.
</p>

<p>
  After four days, most infected people start recovering (<i>recovering</i> in the diagram), but some develop more severe symptoms
  and have to be hospitalized.
</p>


<h3>Reinfection model</h3>

<p>
  We currently have no reliable data on the issue
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2#Reinfection">
  of reinfection</a>. It seems that repeated infections of Covid-19 are rather rare, but judging from other coronavirus types
  (such as those that cause the common cold)
  <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/27/1000569/how-long-are-people-immune-to-covid-19/">we can
  assume</a> that the immunity is not permanent. For our game, we used exponential distribution to model the loss of immunity
  and set the mean length of the immunity period at one year.
</p>


<h3>Hospitalisation model</h3>

<p>
  In our model, we decided to simplify and presume that everyone who dies of Covid goes to the hospital before death.
  We set the length of hospital stays for Covid victims at 7 days, and for survivors at 21 days.
  The average length of the hospital stay is closer to the average for severe cases, according to the figures from the
  <a href="https://koronavirus.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Prezentace-Syst%C3%A9m-akutn%C3%AD-l%C5%AF%C5%BEkov%C3%A9-p%C3%A9%C4%8De-v-kontextu-aktu%C3%A1ln%C3%AD-situace-n%C3%A1kazy-COVID-19-v-%C4%8CR.pdf">Czech Ministry
    of Health presentation</a>. An important thing for our model is the number of days in hospital per one registered
  case, which equals to about 0.6 days per survivor.
</p>

<p>
  The hospital capacity in our model Czech Republic was an optimistic
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_Czech_Republic#Statistics">estimate</a>,
  with 25 thousand beds, 9 thousand of which count as free for coronavirus patients. We estimated the price of one day in hospital
  for a mild or moderate case at 5,000 CZK, while the price of one hospital day for a severe case is
  60,000 CZK. Since severe cases amount to roughly 17.2% of all hospital days, we set the average price of hospitalisation
  at 14,500 CZK per day.
</p>

<p>
  If hospital capacity is exceeded, we double the mortality of the disease, even though in reality, healthcare would degrade
  gradually, starting even before hospital capacity were officially exceeded. We chose this simple coefficient to
  illustrate the situation. We believe that overworking healthcare staff even for a few weeks is completely
  unsustainable.
</p>


<h3> Reproduction number model</h3>

<p>
  We model our reproduction number based on the following article:
  <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/12/15/science.abd9338">Inferring the effectiveness
  of government interventions against COVID-19 in the Science journal</a> (co-authored by Czech scientist Jan Kulveit
  from FHI, University of Oxford). We decided to use the mean values (on a log scale) of measure efficiency from
  the paper:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Restrictions on gatherings (especially for cultural or sports events and celebration)
    <ul>
      <li>More than 1,000 people: 23 %</li>
      <li>More than 100 people: 34 %</li>
      <li>More than 10 people: 42 %</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Restrictions on services
    <ul>
      <li>
        High-risk (includes restaurants, bars, gyms, and similar services that have a high risk of transmission): 18 %</li>
      </li>
      <li>
        All except for essentials (closing down all shops and services except for essential ones selling groceries,
        fuel
        etc.): 27 %</li>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>


  <li>
    Distance learning. It’s impossible to distinguish between the effect of closing down universities and primary and secondary schools. We therefore
    decided to the effect into two parts (using log scale)
    <ul>
      <li>Closing universities: 17 %</li>
      <li>Closing all schools: 38 %</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Lockdown effect (as an additional restriction combined with all others): 13%</li>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The article did not estimate the effects of mask-wearing, as this low-cost measure was in force in the observed countries
  throughout most of the pandemic. In our game, making masks obligatory has no disadvantages. However, if you do decide not to introduce this measure,
  your reproduction number will increase by 14 %, which is a very conservative estimate using the results of an older meta-study
  on mask efficiency <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext"> published in the Lancet
  journal</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Our model also takes seasonal effects into accounts. Their effect on the reproduction number in the logarithmic scale is expressed by cosine with its peak in
  mid-January. In the game, the pandemic is quite seasonal and the multiplier ranges from 1/1.34 (in summer) to 1.34
  (in winter). It is very important to plan future changes based on how quickly the disease spreads. The game will notify you when the seasons change,
  but the changes to the reproduction number are gradual.
</p>

<p>
  Last but not least, our model includes the effects of tracing. We chose to use an illustrative model similar to how we model mortality
  if hospital capacity is exceeded. If the incidence is under 1,000 new cases a day, we use a 10% tracing bonus for the reproduction
  number.
</p>

<p>
  Any measures can be introduced in 3.5 days.
</p>


<h2>Society, measures, and the economy</h2>

<p>
  Mathematics is quite good in describing the basic models of how a pandemic spreads. But then there are more complex issues,
  which have a crucial effect on our lives. These key pandemic mitigation factors include the efficiency of the state, the speed of introducing new
  measures, or compliance with these measures. While designing the game,
  we tested a number of concepts that would reflect these factors in a realistic way: The state having a limited capacity to introduce
  measures. Measures not always being introduced successfully. Compliance with measures decreasing as public trust
  in the government decreased. In the end, we decided to choose a simple design principle: always choosing
  and optimistic version that would make managing the pandemic easier for the player.
</p>

<p>
  Measures therefore always take roughly three days to introduce and they are always introduced successfully; there is never any confusion about the rules. People
  generally comply with the measures; tracing works as long as the capacity is not exceeded. The opposition is constructive and doesn’t block
  the government’s work. In times of major crisis, opposition parties even help slightly slow down the disease. Detecting new cases
  especially was made easier: we show tested new cases quickly, without false positives, and with very little delay.
  You also cannot run out of testing capacities: if you need to test 100,000 people per day, you can. We believe this simplified design
  is the fairest option we can offer.
</p>

<p>
  In our simulation we also had to deal with two more variables. The game has a key part, which in reality
  would of course not be measurable on a day-by-day basis - social stability. That is based on an ever-present
  dilemma in every pandemic mitigation effort: keeping measures in force too long is unsustainable not only from a financial point of view.
  The citizens of our model Central European country with 10M inhabitants will simply not accept a full lockdown for
  over a year, which is the duration of our game. At the same time, everybody wants the pandemic to be dealt with (somehow)
  and too many deaths also cause a strong negative reaction in society. If these sources of discontent
  reach their critical values in our model democracy of our model state, it will cause the government to fall and the
  simulation to end prematurely.
</p>

<p>
  These problems are summarized by the social stability number for us. It’s a pure construct; an artificial scale going from 0 to 100.
   Stability goes down if measures are in effect too long or if the death rate goes too high. Good news
  and longer periods with no measures reassure the citizens. In reality, measuring anything like that is of course impossible;
  we can only consider secondary sources, preferences, the number of protests against the government, or the strength
  of the state apparatus. For the game, however, we needed a predictable system that would reflect the player’s choices
  and simulate the mood in a Central European country.
</p>


<h1>How did we calculate the costs of the measures?</h1>

<p>
  Firstly, we need to explain the point of the game’s economic model. Calculating costs and shifting them from the reality
  into an extremely simplified game model is very difficult and we were not trying to create a system that would be
  accurate and fit 1:1. The model cannot reflect whether a certain part of the market gets stronger or weaker (which usually means that
  poor enterprises get poorer, while big companies have more opportunities to adapt and draw subsidies). The model can reflect
  that the player’s decisions to pay for compensation will mean an expenditure, but it cannot take into account that thanks
  to this compensation, the state may save money on unemployment benefits in the future. The model also only reflects industry
  vicariously: our measures are not directly focused on it. We also do not take into account effects that we believe to be obvious -
  for example that it makes sense economically to motivate people to get tested and to self-isolate, in order to decrease the number of transmissions.
  For a number of effects, we either did not have reliable sources or the space in our simple game model. We see the
  whole economic model as the most open part of the model. We will be happy to update it in the future and while we
  are convinced of the proportions of how much different measures cost (a hard lockdown is much more costly than closing
  universities), we are well aware that the absolute numbers could be calculated differently and we’ll be happy
  for suggestions on what to improve.
</p>

<p>
  Our main source of data was Eurostat’s database by industry NAMA_10_A64. We used the 2019 data for the Czech Republic
  and then modified them using the predicted growth for 2020 (5%: 3% inflation + 2% real growth). We defined
  sectors of the economy that would be affected by each measure and the extent to which they’d be affected (using
  percentages).
</p>

<p>
  Specifically:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Border closures: </strong>The accommodation and food service activities sector contributes an estimated 344 mill. CZK per day to
    the economy. A border closure will limit the activities in this sector by 30%, meaning the costs will amount to 103 mill. CZK per day. The losses
    in the travel agency sector amount to an additional 36 mill. per day. The “spillover effect” (supply chains, drop in demand) will
    then also cause a decrease in industrial output by 6%. In total, the costs will amount to 389 mill. CZK per day.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Restrictions on public gatherings:</strong> In 2020, the arts and leisure sector would have contributed
    an estimated 117 mill CZK per day to the GDP. A ban on mass gatherings will affect 100% of this sector and lower
    industry output in general by 3%. Partial bans (events with more than 1,000 or 100 people) have a proportional effect.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>High-risk services closures:</strong> The accommodation and food service activities sector contributes an estimated 344
    mill. CZK per day to the economy. Restricting high-risk services will limit these activities by 70%, meaning the costs per one day will amount to 241
    mill. CZK. Losses caused by sports ground closures amount to an additional 51.9 mill. CZK, while lowering industry output by 6%
    equals to a loss of 250 mill CZK. In total, this would be 0.54 billion CZK.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Closing all shops except for essentials:</strong> Retail (including grocery shops) contributes
    an estimated 708 mill CZK per day to the economy. Closing non-essential shops will therefore cost 70% of this amount, meaning 495
    mill. CZK. Closing repair shops and similar services, such as hairdressers, will cost an additional 114 mill. CZK per day, while
    limiting industry output by 9% will cost 375 million CZK. In total, the losses would amount to 984 million CZK.
  </li>

    <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zM_M3uRjowznnxVlH5pHdoacrnIoujdf/view?usp=sharing">here</a>
  </li>
</ul>


<p>
  <strong>Other measuers where we used data from other sources:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lockdown:</strong> A lockdown is more than the sum of individual measures,
    because it affects the whole economy. Based on the
            <a href="http://www.koronerv-20.cz/en/koronerv-20-cz-o-nas/">Czech KoroNERV-20</a> analyses presented by an association of experts to the government,
    we decided to use a conservative estimate and set the costs of one day of lockdown at 3.5 billion CZK (this also
    includes all of the abovementioned measuers, so they are not added on top of this).
  </li>
<li>
  <strong> School closures: </strong>During the spring school closure, the government paid roughly 7.06 billion CZK for child-care benefits. Schools
  were closed from the 11th of March to the end of June, so costs per day amount to 64 million CZK.
</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Masks, hands, distancing:</strong> In reality, this measure naturally caused a lot of change, but they either caused one
    one-off expense (interior modifications) or we don’t have enough reliable sources that point at daily costs
    that would be relevant for the game.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Hospitalisation</strong>: When estimating the hospitalisation costs, we used
    <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2020-305">the Czech remuneration order</a> issued for this purpose..
    One hospital day for a mild or moderate case costs 5,000 CZK in the game, while for a severe case it’s
    60,000 CZK.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Compensation</strong>: The game design always works with a certain level of basic compensations that are turned on any time you introduce any
    measures. However, you also have the opportunity to turn on “extra compensation”. That represents a very generous contribution to the economy,
    which the player can use to compensate for stability issues. These special compensations are intentionally very generous and meant
    to only be a short-term measure. We have to admit that our way of estimating them was quite arbitrary:
    the programmes that exist in the real Czechia often do not reach their intended beneficiaries or do not get used at all. We based our estimate on
    the full sum of all compensations planned in all the sectors presented in the game and then we added
    Germany’s whole <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/cs/IP_20_2180">”umbrella”</a> scheme.
  </li>
</ul>
